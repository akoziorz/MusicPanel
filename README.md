## About

### Description
It is anticipated that this app will serve as a dynamic, dashboard-oriented way to let Spotify users analyze their usage of the app, including their personal listening habits and favourite songs, artists, and playlists. However, this scope of this project is subject to change as development of this app continues.

### Usage

A website is yet to be created and hosted.


## Journey
### Inspiration
Inspired by my current data science work as well as similar projects to this one, I wanted to put a unique dashboard spin to analyzing Spotify usage, as well as allow for broader analysis in constrast to current Spotify-related projects. I believe that such an app would be very beneficial and interesting to Spotify users, and by working on this app, I would grow as a software developer in the process.
